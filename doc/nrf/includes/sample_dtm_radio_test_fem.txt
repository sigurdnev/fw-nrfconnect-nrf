You can add support for the nRF21540 front-end module (FEM) to the sample.
Set ``-DNRF21540EK_FEM=y`` when you invoke ``west build`` or ``cmake`` in your sample directory.
Follow the instructions in :ref:`cmake_options`.
For example:

``west build -b nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpunet -- -DNRF21540EK_FEM=y``

When you set ``NRF21540EK_FEM=y`` the :file:`dts-nrf21540-fem.overlay` devicetree overlay file is used to override the default settings.
The configuration from this file is merged with the additional development kit overlay file from the :file:`boards` folder if it exists.

The :file:`dts-nrf21540-fem.overlay` is located in the |fem_file_path| folder.
Make sure that the GPIOs and the SPI configuration in the file correspond to those in which your front-end module is connected.

.. note::
   You must set ``NRF21540EK_FEM=y`` if you use the nRF21540 EK.
   If you use the nRF21540 DK, build your application for the :ref:`nrf21540dk_nrf52840 <zephyr:nrf21540dk_nrf52840>` board.
   The devicetree for the nRF21540 DK already contains the required FEM configuration, so you do not need to set an additional build option.

Sometimes, you may need to add an extra overlay file.
The easiest way to add the file when building is to set it in the ``DTC_OVERLAY_FILE`` variable.
However, that will override the default settings.
When you set the ``DTC_OVERLAY_FILE`` variable, you must specify all overlay files that are needed for building.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`cmake_options` to specify the ``DTC_OVERLAY_FILE`` variable.
For example, to build the sample from the command line for an nRF5340 DK with an attached nRF21540 EK, invoke the following command within the sample directory:
``west build -b nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpunet -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE="boards/nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpunet.overlay;../configuration/dts-nrf21540-fem.overlay;your_overlay_file.overlay"``

See :ref:`zephyr:set-devicetree-overlays` for different ways of adding the overlay file.

Alternatively, you can copy the contents of :file:`dts-nrf21540-fem.overlay` to the board's overlay file.

.. note::
   The nRF5340 DK network core peripherals, like UART and SPI, share an ID and a base address.
   To configure the nRF21540 front-end module gain, write the gain value over the SPI.
   In samples, UART is used as a control interface or shell transport.
   To send the gain value UART is temporary disabled and restarted after the SPI transfer.
