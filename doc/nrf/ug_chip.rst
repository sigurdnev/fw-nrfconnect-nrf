Connected Home over IP (CHIP)
#############################

.. chip_intro_start

CHIP is an open-source application layer project that aims at creating a unified communication standard across smart home devices, mobile applications, and cloud services.
It supports a wide range of existing technologies, including Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth LE, and uses IPv6-based transport protocols like TCP and UDP to ensure connectivity between different kinds of networks.

Connected Home over IP is in an early development stage and must be treated as an experimental feature.

The |NCS| allows you to develop applications that are compatible with the Connected Home over IP project.


Architecture
************

CHIP defines an application layer on top of the IPv6-based transport protocols.
This allows for routing messages regardless of the underlying physical and link layers.

   CHIP architecture overview

The CHIP application layer can be broken down into several main components, from IP framing and transport management up to Data Model structure and Application itself.
For detailed description, see the `CHIP Protocol Overview`_ page.

Integration with |NCS|
======================

The CHIP project is included in the |NCS| as one of the submodule repositories managed with the :ref:`zephyr:west` tool.
That is, the code used for |NCS| and CHIP integration is stored in the CHIP repository and is compiled when building one of the available :ref:`chip_samples`.
Both instances depend on each other, but their development is independent to ensure that they both support the latest stable version of one another.

CHIP is located on the top application layer of the integration model, looking from the networking point of view.
|NCS| and Zephyr provide the Bluetooth LE and Thread stacks, which must be integrated with the CHIP stack using a special intermediate layer.
The |NCS|'s Multiprotocol Service Layer (MPSL) driver allows running Bluetooth LE and Thread concurrently on the same radio chip.
